### JustNineGags

A simple 9GAG feed reader, that shows only 9 gags every hour, so we're not going to get caught in the time wasting vortex, but we'll still get hour healthy laughs.

I made this project because I wanted to learn how to use [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org/), and I don't like tutorials that doesn't build something useful and with more creativity than _"a table with a list of cities"_.

Enjoy and please send feedbacks.
